title: "HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Developing a Real Time Clock, a Random Password Generator, and a To-Do List"
---
I developed these three applications to strengthen my skillset in web design
using HyperText Markup Language (HTML), Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), and
JavaScript (JS). The clock displays the current Pacific Standard Time, while the
random password generator and the to-do list are integrated into the portfolio
using <i>CodePen</i>. I'm excited to showcase these projects as they represent my
commitment to creating practical and engaging web applications. Feel free to
explore and interact with them!


<h3>Real Time Clock</h3>
In this project, I created an analog clock that displays the current time in Pacific Standard Time (PST).
The clock dynamically retrieves the real-time data from the browser and converts it into degree format,
which is then displayed on the clock's hands.

As a side note, I included the logo of the German watch manufacturer <i>Glash√ºtte</i>.
I feel a connection to this brand because it represents the success of a company that emerged from the
East German province and made its mark on the global stage.

<h3>Random Password Generator</h3>

This application allows the user to generate a 14-digit-long random password by pressing the 'Generate' button.
The password consists of a combination of lowercase and uppercase letters of the English alphabet, along with numbers and symbols.

<p>
<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="ExGbOdd" data-user="PaulSchumacher" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">

</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
<p>

Upon pressing on the 'Copy' symbol located to the right of the input box, an alert appears confirming
that the password has been copied to the user's computer.
<p>

<h3>To Do List</h3>
<p>

This program allows the user to create a personalized to-do list. As a task is entered in the input box,
it is automatically added to the list without refreshing the page.

<p class="codepen" data-height="300" data-default-tab="html,result" data-slug-hash="XWozyOP" data-user="PaulSchumacher" style="height: 300px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;">
  <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/PaulSchumacher/pen/XWozyOP">
  To-Do List</a> by Paul Schumacher (<a href="https://codepen.io/PaulSchumacher">@PaulSchumacher</a>)
  on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
</p>
<script async src="https://cpwebassets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
<p>
Once a task is fulfilled, the user can click the green check button to mark the task as done.
If the user wants to remove a task, he or she can press the red trash button to delete it from the list.

Below, I've added a few tasks for you, so please don't forget to reach out to me!
